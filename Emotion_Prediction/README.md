Deep neural network (DNN) with weight sparsity control (DNN-WSP; i.e., L1-norm regularization) improved 
the classification performance using whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of 
schizophrenia patient and healthy groups. Also, initializing DNN's weights through stacked auto-encoder enhanced 
the classification performance (Jang et al., Neuroimage 2017, Kim et al., Neuroimage, 2016). 

The DNN code is for regression anlaysis to predict emotional responses (i.e., scores) from whole-brain fMRI data. 
The Python codes were modified from the DeepLearningTutorials (https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials) 
to apply a node-wise and layer-wise control of weight sparsity via Hoyer sparseness (Kim and Lee, PRNI2016 & ICASSP2017).
